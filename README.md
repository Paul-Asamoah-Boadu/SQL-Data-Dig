<h1>SQL Data Dig</h1>

This project showcases the creation and population of an SQL table named "Inventory". The table contains information on the sales and profits of different products across various regions and dates.

<h2>Table Structure</h2>

`Id`: An integer that serves as the primary key for each entry.

`orderdate`: A date string in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD" that represents the date of the order.

`profit`: A float representing the profit made from the order.

<h2>Table Content</h2>

The "Inventory" table is populated with a total of 30 entries with different values for each column.

<h2>Queries</h2>

Advanced SQL SELECT queries to make discoveries about various datasets. 
Some of the key concepts tackled in this project were:
- how to analyze grouped and ungrouped data, 
- filter data using the WHERE clause, and 
- aggregating and summarizing data using Postgres clauses. 
Further queries can be performed on the "Inventory" table to analyze and extract meaningful information from the data.
